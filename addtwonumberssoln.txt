To solve this problem, we can traverse both linked lists simultaneously, adding the corresponding digits and keeping track of any carry-over. We'll create a new linked list to store the result as we iterate through the input lists.

In this code, we define a ListNode class to represent a node in the linked list. The addTwoNumbers() function takes two linked lists, l1 and l2, as parameters and returns the resulting linked list after adding the numbers.

We iterate through the input lists while calculating the sum of the corresponding digits and maintaining the carry-over value. We create a new node for each digit and append it to the result linked list. Finally, we return the result linked list.

Running the code with the given examples will produce the expected output.

Note: The code assumes that the input linked lists are not modified during the addition process, as specified in the problem statement.
