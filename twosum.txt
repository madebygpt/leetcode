This code utilizes a dictionary (num_map) to store the complement of each number encountered in the nums list. It iterates through the list and checks if the complement of the current number exists in the dictionary. If it does, it means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target, so we return their indices. If no solution is found, we return an empty list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the nums list, since we traverse the list once. The space complexity is also O(n) because, in the worst case, we may need to store all the numbers in the dictionary.
